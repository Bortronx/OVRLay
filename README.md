A(n)? (Hopefully) Easy-to-use toolkit for developing OpenVR Overlays with Unity Engine!

---

What is OVRLay?
=

OVRLay is a small toolkit for creating Overlays for Open/Steam VR,

It provides the neccassary OpenVR API's, Plugins, and Unity Prefabs to enable a sort of drag-and-drop ease of use.

## Features
- Implements and Supports most OpenVR Overlay Features / Settings / Flags!

- Create and Manipulate Both In-Game, and Dashboard Menu Overlays!

- Support for the lastest Stable Release of Unity (2017.1)!

- Does not use Unity's Built-In OpenVR support, but has its own OpenVR Handler that deals with getting a connection to SteamVR, getting the HMD and Right/Left controller positions, and updating / handling Overlay Relevant OpenVR events!

- Has drop-in support for interaction with unmodified UnityUI, by simulating mouse screen cords via a in-scene camera!
